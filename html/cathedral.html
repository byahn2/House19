          The Kingdom of Dresser is known for its dedication to beauty and art.  
          Here, the buildings are all colorful and shiny, and the people are known for their high fashion.  
          Itâ€™s also a very religious kingdom with many ceremonies and celebrations worshipping Vogue the Goddess of Beauty.  
          At the heart of the capital city is the Shadow of Eye Cathedral, a massive church with gorgeous, colorful stained glass windows.  
          On the east wall is The Eye: a massive circular window spanning from floor to ceiling.  
          When the sun rises, it shines through this window and fills the church with magnificent colors.<br><br>
          
          I'm not particularly religious, but when I took this photo of the light pouring in through the eye, it was a truly spiritual experience.
