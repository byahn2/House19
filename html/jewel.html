          The Kingdom of Dresser is the world's greatest export of luxury items including silks, precious metals, fine clothes, and jewelry.  
          Visitors can go pearl diving in Jewel Cove led by a native guide.  The cove is littered with oysters containing beautiful pearls.  
          It’s not all fun and games though.  Sharks and stingrays also enjoy the shallow, sunny waters of the cove.  
          They’ll leave you alone as long as you present no harm, but it certainly makes it more thrilling than your average day at the beach.
