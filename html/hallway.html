          Very few people live outside of the United Kingdoms of Bedroom.  
          To the far north is the icy land of Bathroom, and between The United Kingdoms of Bedroom and Bathroom are the great Hallway Plains. 
          This is where the majority of crops for Bedroom are grown.  The area is massive and almost completely flat.  
          You can see for miles over the fields, and the great blue sky looks like a large tapestry laid out over the fields.
