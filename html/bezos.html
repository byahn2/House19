          The center of Basement is covered by widely spaced mountains known as the Bezos Mountains.  
          These towering structures are made of a stiff, brown stone that breaks at hard right angles.  
          While they look unstable, they have been standing for as long as people have visited Basement.  
          Recent research has shown that they’re actually growing, but as far as we know, there’s no precious materials inside worth exploring or mining. <br><br>

          Of all the places I've travelled, Basement was the most terrifying.
          These mountains feel menacing and like they might be full of nasty creatures I'd rather avoid.
          Needless to say, we did not stay here long.
