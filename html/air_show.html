          <a class="ref" href="trooper.html"> The Peopleâ€™s Union of Living Room </a> is known for its wonderful forms of entertainment.  
          One of the most exciting of these is the Dart Air Show held every weekend outside the city of Darts.  
          Two teams of planes race through the sky with the goal of flying through hoops of different sizes.  
          The most points are awarded for shooting through the smallest circle known as the Bullseye.  
          Crowds travel from all over the world to see these air shows, drinking happily and cheering for their favorite team.<br><br>
          
          I had the pleasure of staying in darts for a few weeks, and rooted for the red team throughout the championship tournament.
          This is a photo I took early in the tournament in which the Red Bulls (the team I was rooting for) was winning.
          Unfortunately, after this game, their luck ran out, and they did fairly badly for the rest of the time I was visiting.
