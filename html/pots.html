          The country of Kitchen borders Living Room and is more socialist than the Kingdoms of Bedroom, but not communist like Living Room.  
          There are many public spaces and resources, but it is built on the foundation of a competitive market and private property.  
          No one goes hungry, but the quality of food you eat depends on the time and effort you put in.  
          The capital of Kitchen is Potsopolis, which is a very industrial city composed primarily of factories.  
          Like the rest of Kitchen, Pots City is well known for its restaurant scene.  
          Some of the best food in the world can be found here, but be careful!  
          There are many bad restaurants hidden among the good, and it can be difficult to tell exactly what you’re getting until it’s on your plate.
