          Another perilous feature of Bathroom is the Flush.  
          Cold water flows around the North Side of the continent and spills into the bay, mixing with warm water and creating strong currents that occasionally cause a whirlpool to form.  
          These whirlpools are unpredictable, and most people stay clear of the bay if they can help it. <br><br>
          
          I took this photo while flying over the Flush in a balloon last summer, and the sound it made was deafening.
