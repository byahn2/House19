          Off the coast of Kitchen is the Desert Island of Oven.  
          Itâ€™s far too hot here for any civilizations to be built, but its heat is used to fuel much of the goings on in Kitchen.  
          The island is covered with this beautiful phenomenon known as the Desert Flowers.  
          These are interesting formations in which natural gas leaks from holes in the ground and immediately catches fire in the immense heat of the desert.  
          The effect is like a field of very pretty, very dangerous flowers.<br><br>

          I took this photo on a boat tour.  
          We didn't actually step on the land, but I was able to see the thousands of "flowers" covering the desert island and to feel the heat wafting off of them. <br>
