          If you head deep into Kitchen, beyond the bustling cities of <a class="ref" href="pots.html"> Potsopolis </a> and 
          <a class="ref" href="spice.html"> Spiceton </a> and the extensive <a class="ref" href="bags.html"> Bags Canyon </a> 
          you will come across the Forgotten Ruins of Dirty Dishes.  
          This ancient city was once the capital of Kitchen: a bountiful, clean, center of community, but now it lies dilapidated, grimy, and forgotten.
          A revolution burned it to the ground, and millions of lives were lost.
          Very few people visit.  
          It is a place people would rather not remember.<br><br>

          I travelled to the Forgotten Ruins by boat after exiting Bags Canyon.
          The only sound we could hear when we landed was the echo of our footsteps and the wind whistling through the fallen towers.
          We did not stay long.<br>
