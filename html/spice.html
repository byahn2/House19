          One of the most enjoyable cities to visit in Kitchen is Spice City.  
          This city is located in a temperate location perfect for growing many spices, and the areas surrounding it are largely made up of spice fields.  
          The cuisine here is unimaginably good with flavors for all different kinds of dishes.  
          They’re particularly well known for their spicy food, and visitors are welcomed to take spice challenges in which they eat progressively more spicy food.  
          Aside from food, Spiceton is also known for its loud, friendly culture and its colorful, bustling streets.  
          If you’re lucky enough to be there during a festival weekend, you can join in with the locals in extensive dance parties that last all night.
