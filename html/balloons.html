        <p>
          In the summer in the Kingdom of Dresser, you can witness the Summer Balloon Spectacle.  
          The nobility of Dresser all own brightly colored hot air balloons and fly them every week of the summer to a different part of the kingdom for a celebration.  
          The tradition is meant to encourage good relations between the nobility and their people.  
          While only high status individuals are invited to the main celebration, the streets in whichever city the nobility are visiting are often filled with festivity.  
          The people wear bright colors and exchange presents, and children watch the skies for a glimpse of those beautiful satin balloons.
