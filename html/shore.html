          While Bathroom is far too cold for anyone to swim, there are beautiful icy beaches along the coast.  
          The ice freezes in small round sections like pebbles, and the waves crash gently on the shores.  
          Every now and then, a major storm comes through, and the beaches are flooded, removing the dirt and grime and returning them to their icy white simplicity.
