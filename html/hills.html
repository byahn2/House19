          In the Kingdom of Muse are the rolling Guitarto Hills.  
          This Kingdom is best known for its musical, with its two major cities of Guitarto and Pianokeyo.  
          The Kingdom of Muse is a hub for musicians of all sorts, and people from around the world visit for concerts and in the hopes of making it big in the world of music.  
          Classical musicians tend to migrate to Pianokeyo which is a more posh and traditional city, while singer song-writers flock to Guitarto to explore a diverse range of up and coming styles.  
          Guitarto was built in these massive hills in part because they provide beautiful acoustics.  
          When music is played in the city, it reverberates through the surrounding hillside, echoing for miles.<br><br>
          
          I took this photo while at an outdoor concert in Guitarto where I was listening to a good friend perform an accoustic version of the hit song "Wonderwall"
