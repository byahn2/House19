          Traveling throughout Downstairs in the COVID Circus. 
          This is a large camp ground full of tents surrounding a massive fountain filled with sanitizer.  
          Inside each tent, live events are held in which people report on catastrophes, act out horrible events, or host twisted comedies on life and the world.  
          Unlike a traditional circus, this circus is incredibly sanitary.  
          All visitors must remain at least six feet apart, and bathe in the Sanitizer Fountain upon arriving and before leaving.  
          While it is very clean, it is also poorly organized, and there is an incredible amount of misinformation about admission rates, show times, safety precautions, and where their next appearance will be.  
          Nothing is ever certain about the COVID Circus, so itâ€™s important to be prepared for anything.
