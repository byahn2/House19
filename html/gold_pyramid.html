          Deep in the <a class="ref" href="rainforest.html"> HousePlant Rainforest </a>, along the river MiniFridge is a clearing where no plants grow.  
          At the center of the clearing is the massive Pyramid of Gold.  
          This ancient relic is believed to have been built long ago by a people who worshipped a God of Revelry.  
          Long ago, the pyramid was pillaged, but many who tried died from mysterious booby traps designed to protect the pyramid.  
          When <a class="ref" href="trooper.html"> Colonel Trooper </a> united Living Room, he made it illegal to be within 500 feet of the structure, and it is surrounded by armed guards.  
          Tourists can still visit the pyramid, as long as they don't get too close.<br><br>
          
          To get to the pyramid, I took a boat tour down the River Beer.  
          When we got to the clearing and the boat docked, I was able to get a clear shot of this magnificent, shining structure.
