          Traveling throughout Downstairs in the COVID Circus. 
          This is a large camp ground full of tents surrounding a massive fountain filled with sanitizer.  
          Inside each tent, live events are held in which people report on catastrophes, act out horrible events, or host twisted comedies on life and the world.  
          Unlike a traditional circus, this circus is incredibly sanitary.  
          All visitors must remain at least six feet apart, and bathe in the Sanitizer Fountain upon arriving and before leaving.    
          Nothing is ever certain about the COVID Circus, so itâ€™s important to be prepared for anything.<br><br>

          I spent one week at the COVID Circus, and it was by far one of the more unpleasant experiences I've had in my travels.  
          I took this photo as I was leaving, and I hope to never go back.<br>
