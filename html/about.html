          This piece is called HOUSE-19 and was created as part of Bryce Elizabeth Yahn's independent study.
          It serves as the capstone to her Take-5 Scholarship which allowed her to study the ability of photography to manipulate perception.<br><br>
          
          Bryce is graduating from the University of Rochester in May 2021 with a BS in Brain and Cognitive Science and a minor in mathematics.
