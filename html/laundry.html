          The Kingdom of Bed is a land for spirituals and dreamers.  
          The people here tend to live simple lives in small towns where they meditate and seek peace and spiritual inspiration.  
          These peaceful towns lie in the shadow of the great Mountains of Dirty Laundry: a towering mountain range separating Bed from the rest of <a class="ref" href="lady.html"> BedRoom </a>.  
          These snowcap peaks are made of many different types of colorful rocks that create a beautiful mosaic on the horizon.  
          Once, when people first migrated to Bed, these mountains were so small as to be nonexistent, but overtime, theyâ€™ve grown, moved by forces beyond our control and comprehension.<br><br>
          
          I've lived in the shadows of the Mountains of Dirty Laundry for much of my life, but they never cease to amaze me.  
          This is the first photograph I took on my journey, and I love it particularly because it reminds me of home.
