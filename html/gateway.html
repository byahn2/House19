          Here, near the mouth of the Sink River is what is known as the Gateway to the Sea.  
          It is a great silver arch through which you can see the vast endless ocean.  
          Travelers often leave small pieces of cloth on it to symbolize good luck and act as a marker of their visit.<br><br>
          
          This was the last photograph I took in Bathroom as we were leaving.
          I remember seeing this massive wave rise up almost as high as the top of the arch, and it felt like the ocean waving me goodbye.
