          The Northern coast of Bathroom is lined with steep ice cliffs that drop directly into the raging sea below.  
          Some adventurous tourists risk death to climb them, but for the more faint of heart, there is a long, sturdy metal platform you can walk out on about halfway down the cliffs to view them.  
          In the winter, they are completely dark, so few people travel here, but in the summer, the sunlight makes the cliffs sparkle a translucent blue, and the rocky features of the land at the top casts great shadows across the cliffs.
