          At the tip of the United Kingdoms of Bedroom is the statue known as Lady Lumiance.  
          Bedroom is known as a land of knowledge, exploration, and opportunity.  
          Itâ€™s divided into five  kingdoms: Dresser, Desk, Bed, Shelf, and Muse, each of which is dedicated to a particular study or art.  
          People from all over the world travel to Bedroom in search of an opportunity to create a new life for themselves, and the first thing they see as they enter at the bay of Shelf is Lady Luminance standing over them, holding her light like a beacon of hope.
