          While Bathroom is far too cold for anyone to swim, there are beautiful icy beaches along the coast.  
          The ice freezes in small round sections like pebbles, and the waves crash gently on the shores.  
          Every now and then, a major storm comes through, and the beaches are flooded, removing the dirt and grime and returning them to their icy, white simplicity.<br><br>
          
          I took this photo from the balloon at dusk, with the rocks above casting these long, even shadows on the beach.  
          It was so peaceful, that we just floated for hours here, listening to the waves crash on the icy shore.
