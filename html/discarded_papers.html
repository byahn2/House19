          The Kingdom of Desk is dedicated to the pursuit of productivity and industry.  
          At the edge of Desk is the Bay of Discarded Papers.  
          Over time, a pile of discarded papers from Desk builds up, unused, yet held on to in the event that one day there might be a need for them.  
          Eventually, as the pile grows larger and larger, the papers form into tiny boats that sail off into the bay, commandeered for other uses.  
          Some of them run aground and are finally disposed of.  
          Others may drift off to sea and be lost to the clutter of the world.  
          No one knows where these end up, but many people who wish to run away or be forgotten voyage to this bay in the hopes of jumping on one such boat and escaping their busy, industrial lives in Desk.
