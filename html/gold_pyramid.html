          Deep in the HousePlant Rain Forest, along the river MiniFridge is a clearing where no plants grow.  
          At the center of the clearing is the massive Pyramid of Gold.  
          This ancient relic is believed to have been built long ago by a people who worshipped a God of Revelry.  
          The massive golden blocks that hold up the pyramid are filled with fermented grains and other herbs that have drug-like effects on the body, creating a sense of elation and relaxation.  
          Long ago, the pyramid was pillaged, but many who tried died from mysterious booby traps designed to protect the pyramid.  
          When Colonel Trooper united Living Room, he made it illegal to be within 500 feet of the structure, and it is surrounded by armed guards.  
          Tourists can still visit the pyramid, and eat in a bar built to look like a smaller version of the pyramid that is located at the end of the clearing.
