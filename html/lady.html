          At the tip of the United Kingdoms of Bedroom is the statue known as Lady Lumiance.  
          Bedroom is known as a land of knowledge, exploration, and opportunity.  
          Itâ€™s divided into five  kingdoms: <a class="ref" href="cathedral.html"> Dresser</a>, <a class="ref" href="discarded_papers.html"> Desk </a>, <a class="ref" href="laundry.html"> Bed </a>, <a class="ref" href="library.html"> Shelf </a>, and <a class="ref" href="hills.html"> Muse </a>, each of which is dedicated to a particular study or art.  
          People from all over the world travel to Bedroom in search of an opportunity to create a new life for themselves, and the first thing they see as they enter at the bay of Shelf is Lady Luminance standing over them, holding her light like a beacon of hope.<br><br>
          
          Unlike most people, I took this photograph as I was leaving Bedroom to explore and photograph Downstairs and Basement.  
          I felt that she was waving me goodbye and wishing me luck on my travels, reminding me that I would be welcome whenever I chose to return.
