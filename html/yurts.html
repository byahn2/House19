        <p>
          There is a group of people known as The Wanderers who roam the <a class="ref" href="lady.html"> United Kingdoms of Bedroom </a> and live out of small yurts they assemble and disassemble as they move around the countryside.  
          The Wanderers are originally from <a class="ref" href="pots.html"> Kitchen </a> and come to <a class="ref" href="lady.html"> Bedroom </a> seeking knowledge, energy, and warmth.  
          They spend some time in the cities, but then, they grow empty and tired, and join their kindred.  
          Some eventually migrate back to <a class="ref" href="pots.html"> Kitchen </a>, but more always come.<br><br>
          
          I took this photo as we passed by a Wanderer settlment on our way to Muse.  
          It was the middle of the day, but the settlement seemed completely empty.  
          It's possible it was deserted.
