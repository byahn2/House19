          Shortly outside of Potsopolis is the Colander Museum of History, also known as the worldâ€™s greatest architectural masterpiece.  
          The museum documents all types of history including art history, political history, natural history, and ancient history.  
          Scholars who work for the museum travel the world, collecting information and pieces to understand the past and preserve the present for future generations to look back on and learn about.
