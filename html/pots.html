          The country of Kitchen borders <a class="ref" href="trooper.html"> Living Room </a> and is more socialist than the <a class="ref" href="lady.html"> Kingdoms of Bedroom </a>, but not communist like Living Room.  
          There are many public spaces and resources, but it is built on the foundation of a competitive market and private property.  
          No one goes hungry, but the quality of food you eat depends on the time and effort you put in.  
          The capital of Kitchen is Potsopolis, which is a very industrial city composed primarily of factories.  
          In and amongst the factories are some of the best (and worst) restaurants in all of Downstairs. <br><br>

          I took this photograph when we were entering Potsopolis.  
          It didn't seem that exciting or beautiful, but when we sat down to eat at a restaurant our first night, I was blown away.          
          I ended up spending two weeks in Potsopolis visiting every restaurant I could.<br>
