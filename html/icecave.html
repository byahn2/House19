          In North <a class="ref" href="pots.html"> Kitchen </a>, there is an interesting phenomenon in which there is a small area of extreme cold known as Fridge.  
          While few people choose to live there, many people explore it in search of rare resources.  
          The landscape is mountainous and full of ice caves such as this one.  
          Exploration is perilous, but the rewards can be priceless.<br><br>
          
          When I visited, I went on a hiking expedition all the way to the top peak known as Freezer.
          I was scared to go into this cave, but we found this incredible nataural food called "ice-cream" inside.
          We covered it in chocolate and ate it around a fire just outside the cave.
