          Along the coast of Downstairs is a narrow country called The Cabinet of Liquor.  
          The capital of this city is Wine Cellar, but people mainly visit to see the Glass City.  
          On weekends, the city floods with tourists who come for wild nights in the city's many clubs and casinos.  
          Sometimes they leave with fantastic memories and good times.  Other times they leave with headaches and regret.  
          Itâ€™s an excellent place to host birthdays, bachelor parties, and celebrations of all sorts. <br><br>
          
          This is the one nice photo I took in the city.  The rest were blurry and poorly lit, and I lost my camera case at some point.
          In the future, I will be touring with a disposable camera.
