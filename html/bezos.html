          The center of Basement is covered by widely spaced mountains known as the Bezos Mountains.  
          These towering structures are made of a stiff, brown stone that breaks at hard right angles.  
          They tower towards the sky, and while they look unstable, they have been standing for as long as people have visited Basement.  
          Recent research has shown that they’re actually growing, but as far as we know, there’s no precious materials inside worth exploring or mining.
