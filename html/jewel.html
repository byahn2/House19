          The Kingdom of Dresser is the world's greatest export of luxury items including silks, precious metals, fine clothes, and jewelry.  
          Visitors can go pearl diving in Jewel Cove which is littered with oysters containing beautiful pearls.  
          Sharks and stingrays also enjoy the cove, though they'll leave you alone if you leave them alone.<br><br>
          
          I was incredibly nervous to be swimming in shark infested waters, but the sea floor and the pearls where so beautiful, it distracted me from the stingrays swimming below.
