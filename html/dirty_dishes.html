          If you head deep into Kitchen, beyond the bustling cities of <a class="ref" href="pots.html"> Potsopolis </a> and <a class="ref" href="spice.html"> Spiceton </a>, beyond the perilous canyons of Drawers and beneath the Caves of Cabinets, you will come across the Forgotten Ruins of Dirty Dishes.  
          This ancient city is thought to have once been a bountiful, clean, center of community, but now it lies dilapidated, grimy, and forgotten.  
          Great towers have collapsed and build new towers out of piles of rubble.
          Very few people visit.  
          It is a place people would rather not remember.
