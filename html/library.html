          The Kingdom of Shelf is dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge.  
          One of its most treasured establishments is the Books of Shelf in the capital city of Booksburg.  
          The Books of Shelf is a massive library featuring books of science, poetry, art, literature, and philosophy.  
          The books go up to the ceiling and the building is nearly a mile long.  
          Almost all of the world's greatest writers and academics spend some of their life studying here.
