           Puzzle Art Museum is one of the most celebrated havens of art in the world.  
          Itâ€™s a big open space with massive white walls reaching upwards towards the sky.  
          The walls themselves are filled with massive masterpieces from world-renowned artists arranged like a massive gallery.  
          The works are incredibly diverse and can be reassembled into much larger pieces of similar form.  
          For the sake of storage and preservation, they are only assembled as such for special occasions.
