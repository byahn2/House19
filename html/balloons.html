        <p>
          In the summer in the Kingdom of Dresser, you can witness the Summer Balloon Spectacle.  
          The nobility of Dresser all own brightly colored hot air balloons.
          Every week of the summer, they fly to a different part of the kingdom for a celebration.  
          The tradition is meant to encourage good relations between the nobility and their people.  
          While only high status individuals are invited to the main celebration, the streets in whichever city the nobility are visiting are often filled with festivity. <br><br>
          
          The day I took this photo, everyone in town was busily preparing for a festiival, when one of the children cried out "Balloons!".
          Everyone dropped what they were doing and ran to get a good look.
          Sure enough, over the horizon, brightly colored balloons were popping into existance one by one.
          It was truly a sight to behold.  I was  able to borrow an old, worn down balloon for my travels to the rest of HOUSE-19.
